Joomla K2 migration fix for K2 menu items and K2 content

This file is for the purpose of trying to fix Joomla menu items that link to K2 content after a migration from Joomla 1.5 to 2.5

If after migrating your 2.5 menu shows K2 component not found then this file /fix  might help you. 
If you have multiple authors for K2 items then this will probably NOT be for you as it will replace the owner/user/modified by id of k2 items with a single user id

Instructions
